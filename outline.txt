Refactor data structure

Refactor night processing
	Iterate over character order
		If a character is in play, call processing for the player
		Otherwise, skip processing
		
Refactor interactions
	Create premade XML for character interfaces
	Create generalized function that accepts a player to show the interface to and id of a character to process

Concepts
	Log player responses
	Make vote now a majority vote
	Make pause promoted only
	Make marks automatically turn off if a role that requires them is put into play
	Instead of always closing blindfolds it will first check if the player is or is not included in the next phase and act accordingly
	Toggle-able warning for the host that a mandatory night action for an in play role was not performed
	
Master night order list with every possible phase
	Phases become active if the matching character is in play
	Phases will have an array of players which will wake for them
	If a role would result in them being forced to undertake another phase, that phase will be given a reference to the player who must take that phase due to player action

Refactor data structure
	Character order (List of character IDs in order)
	Data structure
		Players
			Role
				Subrole ()
			Mark
			Artifact
			Number
			Protected
		
Refactor night processing
	Iterate over character order
		If a character is in play, call processing for the player
		Otherwise, skip processing
		
Refactor interactions
	Create premade XML for character interfaces
	Create generalized function that accepts a player to show the interface to and id of a character to process

Concepts
	Log player responses
	Make vote now a majority vote
	Make pause promoted only
	
Master night order list with every possible phase
	Phases become active if the matching character is in play
	Phases will have an array of players which will wake for them
	If a role would result in them being forced to undertake another phase, that phase will be given a reference to the player who must take that phase due to player action

data                        (General data object)
	roles                     (Role data array)
		{role_number}           (An object containing data for a particular role)
			role_id               (A unique reference to the role)
			edition               (A value to tell which edition of the game the role originates from)
			card_image            (A link to the card image)
			name                  (The name of the role)
			description           (The description of how the role functions in game)
	order                     (Night order array)
		{phase_number}          (An object containing data for a particular phase in the night order)
			phase_name            (The name of the role or event that this phase is about)
			wakes                 (Whether the role wakes up during the night)
			parents               (The role IDs that must be in play for this phase to occur)
			players               (The players who will wake up for this phase)
			special               (An alternative list of players that require a different process to handle correctly during a phase)
			narrator              (The sound clip to play for this phase)
	game                      (General round data object)
		players                 (An object containing the data for the players in the current round)
			{player_color}        (An object of data for a particular player in the game)
				role                (An object of data for the role the player currently has)
					{...}             (The role object will contain different data depending on the role in question)
				mark                (The id of the mark the player currently owns -1)
				artifact            (The id of the currently owned artifact or -1)
